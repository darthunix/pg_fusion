- Added ProcessUtility guard for CTAS/SELECT INTO:
  - New `utility_hook` installs a `ProcessUtility` hook that detects `CreateTableAsStmt` and sets a thread‑local guard.
  - Planner hook now checks the guard and skips intercepting the inner SELECT for CTAS/SELECT INTO.
  - Removed reliance on `Query` fields like `intoClause`/`canSetTag` for this purpose (bindings differ for PG17).
