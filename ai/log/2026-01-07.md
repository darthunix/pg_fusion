title: Executor/Backend result path synced; protocol stable
updated_at: "2026-01-07"
---

- Verified protocol and dataflow match code: `ExecReady`, per-scan `Eof`, heap meta with SHM `vis_len`.
- Implemented result path: executor encodes rows via `encode_wire_tuple` into result ring; backend assembles `MinimalTuple` and stores in slot.
- ColumnLayout (`PgAttrWire`) sent during planning and used for encoding/alignment.
- Open items: apply vis bitmap in `PgScanStream`; rotate block indices for double buffering; broaden encoder type coverage.
